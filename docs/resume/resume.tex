\section*{PROJECTS}
\textbf{wheredoieat} -- \textit{Python, FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Machine Learning} \hfill 2025
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built full-stack restaurant recommendation application with Content-Based Filtering and Multi-Dimensional Weighted Scoring (cuisine 40\%, dietary 25\%, price 15\%, location 10\%, rating 5\%, features 5\%) and EMA algorithm for preference learning with context-aware scoring multipliers
    \item Designed scalable architecture processing up to 500 candidate restaurants per request using PostGIS geospatial queries, with batch processing (50-100 restaurants) and asyncpg connection pooling, deployed as microservices on Vercel and Railway
    \item Implemented gamified Tinder-like interface enabling users to swipe and interact with recommendations while the system learns from preferences in real-time
\end{itemize}

\textbf{MetaManager} -- \textit{Electron, TypeScript, Node.js, React} \hfill 2025
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built cross-platform desktop application for audio metadata and cover art management with resilient batch processing handling partial failures and unified interface supporting multiple formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV) with format-specific library abstraction (node-id3, music-metadata, wavefile)
    \item Developed IPC communication bridge between React frontend and Node.js backend for secure file operations with custom protocol registration
\end{itemize}

\textbf{PDF-y \& PDF-y Lite} -- \textit{Python, FastAPI, Docker, OCR, MCP, Claude AI} \hfill 2025
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling LLMs to analyze PDFs via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, with hybrid text extraction (pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, Tesseract OCR) achieving 99.5\% accuracy in ~2 seconds
    \item Built advanced table detection system with distinct strategies for bordered and borderless tables, dual-personality architecture serving both MCP and RESTful HTTP API from unified logic, two variants (full-featured and lightweight) with comprehensive Pytest suites, containerized with Docker, Redis, and Nginx
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Medieval Maps} -- \textit{Figma, UI/UX Design, Wireframing, Prototyping} \hfill 2024
