The project began with a command-line version of the game, including input parsing, move validation, and exception handling. In the second phase, the system was expanded with a JavaFX graphical interface, an observer pattern for real-time updates, and interactive move feedback. The final phase introduced a backtracking solver that could automatically compute solutions, integrated into both the CLI and GUI. Throughout development, the team employed version control, pair programming, and JUnit testing to ensure maintainability and reliability.",
