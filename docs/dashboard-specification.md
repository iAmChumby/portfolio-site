## Technical Implementation

### Dashboard Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js API with LowDB for metrics storage
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
- **Authentication**: Secure admin-only access with SMS-based MFA
- **Visualization**: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization

### SMS-Based Authentication System

#### Overview
The dashboard implements a secure SMS-based authentication system that provides dynamic access through temporary URLs, eliminating the need for static login credentials or hidden dashboard links.

#### Architecture Components

**SMS Service Integration**
- **Provider**: Twilio SMS API
- **Webhook Handler**: Processes incoming SMS messages
- **Token Generator**: Creates cryptographically secure access tokens
- **Response Service**: Sends SMS replies with access URLs
- **Phone Whitelist**: Authorized phone number validation

**Security Features**
- **Dynamic URLs**: Each access request generates a unique URL
- **Time-Limited Tokens**: 15-minute expiration for security
- **Phone Number Verification**: Only whitelisted numbers can request access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents SMS spam and abuse attempts
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged for security monitoring
- **IP Restrictions**: Optional IP-based access controls

#### User Experience Flow

1. **Access Request**: User sends SMS to designated Twilio number
2. **Validation**: System validates sender's phone number against whitelist
3. **Token Generation**: Creates secure, time-limited access token
4. **SMS Response**: Sends back temporary dashboard URL via SMS
5. **Dashboard Access**: User clicks URL to access dashboard
6. **Automatic Expiry**: URL becomes invalid after 15 minutes

#### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema (LowDB)**
```json
{
  "sms_tokens": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "token": "cryptographic_hash",
      "phone_number": "hashed_phone",
      "created_at": "timestamp",
      "expires_at": "timestamp",
      "used": false,
      "ip_address": "optional_ip"
    }
  ],
  "authorized_phones": [
    {
      "phone_hash": "hashed_phone_number",
      "label": "admin_phone",
      "active": true,
      "created_at": "timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Environment Variables**
```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_number

- `DELETE /api/admin/sms/revoke/:token` - Manual token revocation

#### Security Considerations

**Token Security**
- Cryptographically secure random token generation
- SHA-256 hashing for phone number storage
- No plaintext phone numbers in database
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

**Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**
- Maximum 5 SMS requests per phone number per hour
- Exponential backoff for repeated failed attempts
- Automatic blocking of suspicious patterns
- Webhook signature verification from Twilio

**Privacy & Compliance**
- Phone numbers hashed before storage
- SMS content never logged
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Automatic data purging after retention period

#### Cost Analysis

**Twilio SMS Pricing (US)**
- Incoming SMS: $0.0075 per message
- Outgoing SMS: $0.0075 per message
- Monthly cost for personal use: ~$1-5
- Webhook hosting: Included in existing infrastructure
